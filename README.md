## Introduction

**Project background and context**

SpaceX is a private aerospace company that has revolutionized space technology by making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of $62m; other providers cost upward of $165m each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine that the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. For this project, we shall examine several machine learning models and then predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

**Questions to answer**

What is the best machine learning algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
Is there a relationship between variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, orbits, and the success of the first stage landing?
